 <h2>Third FEWD Techdegree Project</h2>
 
An online registration form I built using HTML and CSS. The focus of the project was building a responsive newsletter sign up form that included HTML elements, CSS transition and transform properties, and also media queries that allow adjustments to larger screen sizes. It also includes form validation for certain required fields.
